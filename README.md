#**Short Intro:**

The file contains an application called `"BERT ResQ Me!`
This is an application developed in research in compliance with Balanga City National Science High School
and the research team; Initializing New Human Emergency Application Technology
The Vision of this application is to have an easy emegency button for students in their devices to quickly and effectively notify emergency personel
Our research study proved that the application does help in improving the time in emergency response

The Application:

Upon opening the application, you will be presented with six buttons, A "Yes" and "No" buttons corresponding to the question prompt above it which is "Are you in need of assistance?"
Next, is the "Start Service" and "Stop Service" which is an incomplete feature, it was supposed to be a voice detector that recognizes a specific word that automatically opens the app
Unfortunately, I, the head developer, did not figure out how to activate that feature outside the app (The feature can't be on unless the app is on, making it redundant since its purpose is opening the app itself)
Another button is the "Account Button", with this button, you can fill in and access your personal info - and medical info that can be used by medical personel when you activate the app.
The Last button is the "BERT Contact" button, this will let you fill and access the contacts of the medical personel (In our case, our school's emergency team).

The Process:

For the app to properly work, fill in the information needed in the "Account" section.
Then, fill the blank spaces in the "BERT Contact" section with phone numbers you want to notify 
Press the "Yes" button.

Pressing the "Yes" button, immediately alerts all the contacts with a text "Someone is in need of Assistance!"
Then, you will be lead to a map (In this context, it was a simplified version mapping of our school), tapping the location button there will notify the emergency personel of where you are, sending them the code of your location.
Next, an image of a body will be presented, you will tap there where the inflicted area is. Then, you will be presented with six buttons, namely: "Blunt Force", "Burn", "Chemical Burn", "Cuts", "Pierce", "Unconscious".
Pressing one of those will combine your previous button choice, allerting the medical personel to what happened to you (example is arm and burn, the personel will be notified that you have burns on your arms).
After that, you will be lead to a screen where your information is detailed, with a prompt asking you if you are a the victim or the handler (This was made in case the user is not the victim themself and are just using their phone for notifying the medical personel)
If you chose victim, the app will lead you to the account details section for presentation to the medical personel
If you chose Handler, the app will prompt you to make sure to present the Victim's Information.

I would love to develop this app more :D, maybe in the future :o
